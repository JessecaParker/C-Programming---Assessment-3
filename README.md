# C-Programming---Assessment-3

These next group of assignments were meant to increase my knowledge.

In the first assignment, titled "u3a1 Part 1", shows a code that calculates
the amount of money a person made each day that week by using inputs for hourly 
wages and number of hours worked each day that was inputted by the user. It calculates 
what their gross pay is after working their hours, including overtime pay.

In the second assignment, titled "u3a1 Part 2", shows use of while loops and else/if.
It generates a random number, then allows the user to guess the number. The code will output 
if the user is high or low until they have guessed the right answer.

In the third assignment, titled "u3a1 Part 3", grades are inputted from the user
and stored into an array. The grades are then outputted from the array back to 
the user.
